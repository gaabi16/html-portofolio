<h1>The best movies according to Gabi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star wars Episode IV: A new hope</h3>
<p>I really liked the visual effects. They were very good for those times</p> 
<h3>The Creator</h3>
<p>It's a really creative movie and i believe it is more realistic than what the majority of people would think</p>
<h3>The Pope's exorcist</h3>
<p>This movie was one of the only horror movies that actually got me scared. Definitely worth watching.</p>
